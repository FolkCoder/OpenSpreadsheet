# Release Log

## v1.1.4

### Enhancements
+ Continued refactoring test cases to automate testing of additional scenarios.
+ Added automated tests to validate and read worksheets generated by OpenSpreadsheet and subsequently saved by Excel, as Excel automatically modifies XML and causes unexpected errors. 
+ Renamed `ShouldFreezeTopRow` worksheet style property to `ShouldFreezeHeaderRow`.
+ `ShouldAutoFilter` now acts on the user-specified header row, rather than the first row.
+ Header styles are now cached regardless of the value of `ShouldWriteHeaderRow`, which will allow for greater precision when using an explicit `WorksheetWriter`.

### Bug Fixes
+ Changed `WorksheetReader` to handle numbers stored in scientific notation.

## v1.1.3

### Enhancements
+ Began refactoring test cases to automate common scenarios rather than relying on file types and manual scanning.

### Bug Fixes
+ Null cell data types now default to numeric during reading (Excel apparently removes this attribute).
+ Trying to pass Color.Transparent value to various spreadsheet style items will now throw an `ArgumentException`.

## v1.1.2 

### Enhancements
+ Added `Accounting` numbering format.

### Bug Fixes
+ `WorksheetReader` will no longer try to set properties without a public setter.
+ Fixed bug that skipped constants when reading.



## v1.1.1

### Bug Fixes
+ Fixed a bug that duplicated style definitions when reading.

## v1.1.0

### Enhancements
+ Added `ReadUsing` and `WriteUsing` methods (and associated tests) to allow for custom logic to be applied to read and write maps.
+ Added `ReaderRow` class to handle read operations (used for `ReadUsing`).
+ Created more accurate tests for `Default` configuration methods.
